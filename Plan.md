    - RAD Card
        - same sub sections as rr, full clears, speed (cum), speed (legacy), sherpas
        - under each sub section we have three hyperlinks
            - Combined
            - Raids
            - Dungeons
    - Indiv Raid Cards
        - clears
            - hyperlinks to fulls all time/weekly, masters all time/weekly
            - see rr, just add change "total" to "all time" and add "recent" to the right, and lowman to right
                - recent link to past week not best week
                - lowman link to all lowmans, ganular filter on lb
        - speedruns
            - same as above
        - sherpas
            - same as above
        - wf
            - same as rr
    - Indiv dungeon cards
        - same as raids
    - all/Raids/Dungeons buttons
        - clicking one would show and hide appropriate cards


- General Leaderboard
    - keep it simple
    - reference rr in appropriate style
    - add a filter to change activity, sort (clears, speed), past time period (all, weekly), 
        platform (multi select), best time period (best week, etc), Average clear time

    - filters
        - activity (specific raid/dungeon)
        - mode (normal, master, contest, ...)
            - should only display possible modes for the activity
        - FT size (1-6)
            - should we give a range?
            - I dont think we can just do specified size or less
                - this sort of works for speed, (if someone has a faster duo than most)
                - but I think for correctness we should allow for selecting exactly 3
        - Type/Stat
            - full clears
            - clears
            - speed
            - sherpas
            - wf
            - contest ? why would we want this
            - average time
            - total time
            - kills
            - deaths
            - assists
            - feats ****************************************************
        - time period (all, past week, s12, custom date range)
            - for custom date range have a calendar like google flights
        - platform (multi select)
    - should be a way to update the top level filter as well as add a new one
        - if there is more than one filter already then do we still update the top level filter?
        


- Clan Leaderboard
    - have a drop down to select categories that are shown
    - ability to pin categories
        - should pull cat to left
    - ability to slide cats around in personalized order
        - above 3 points should make it easy to add new cats in post

Settings Page
- options to hide/show various elements on profile page
- dark/light mode


Notes:
What should be in the settings page?
would it be nice to have the option to hide/show things? (think last activity or weekly character progress)
- see how raidhub has an expandable option on profiles for this info, as well as shown dots

how would one so about showing/finding their duo ron pb? that may have a solo that hides it or a master duo flaw
- searching your self on the lb may be undesireable

comment on leaderboards?

cache settings?

differentiate between past week and best week

page to compare players?

dungeon wf section is unclear. so next to contest implies solo contest rather than normal solo

for RAD card under speed we need both a cumulative row and a legacy row

add # of instances rank

add top 10 and top 50 rank badge colours since cheaters are gone
